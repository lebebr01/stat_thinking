# Regression Trees

Regression trees are an extension of classification trees where the outcome no longer represents categories (e.g., it snowed or did not snow), but instead the outcome is a continuous or interval type. For example, earlier in this book, distributions of college admission rates were explored, this represented a continuous or interval type attribute as the data took on many different values. Regression trees differ from classification trees in that the outcome of the model is a prediction of the continuous quantity rather than predicting if an observation belongs to a specific category. For example, instead of predicting whether it snows or not, a regression tree would predict how much snow fell, such as 5.5 inches. The difference in the predicted value has a few implications for the model, first, the accuracy measure used to evaluate the model needs to differ as it is unlikely that the prediction will be the same for any of the data in a regression tree, secondly, the prediction task is now much more difficult. These two observations need to be kept in mind when working with a regression tree.

Much of the machinery is similar between regression and classification trees, however. Most notably, the same tree type structure will be used to make the prediction. Also, to parallel the classification trees explored so far, the regression trees used in this text will assume that only two splits can occur at any point along the tree. There are also differences between the classification and regression trees. Already discussed is the outcome attribute is continuous for a regression tree, therefore the predicted value will represent one that is continuous as well instead of representing a category. Furthermore, since the predictions are done on a continuous scale, a different measure of overall model fit or accuracy will have to be used. This chapter will explore those details in turn. But first, an example of a regression tree.

## Predicting ACT Score
The first example of using a regression tree will attempt to predict the median ACT score for a college institution using other attributes that describe the type of college. Before getting into the model, the packages and loading of the data needs to be done.  

### Loading R packages
The following code will load the packages to use for the fitting of the regression tree and loading of the college scorecard data that was used earlier in the book (see Chapters 2 and 3). 

```{r load-colleges, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggformula)
library(mosaic)
library(rpart)
library(rsample)
library(rpart.plot)
library(statthink)
library(parttree)

# Set theme for plots
theme_set(theme_statthinking())

# Load in data
colleges <- read_csv(
  file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lebebr01/statthink/master/data-raw/College-scorecard-clean.csv", 
  guess_max = 10000
  )
```

### Visualize distributions
Exploring the distribution of the variable of interest is often the first step in an analysis. A density figure is used to understand 

```{r density-act, fig.cap = "Density curve of median college ACT score."}
gf_density(~ actcmmid, data = colleges) %>%
  gf_labs(x = "Median college ACT score")
```

1. What are the primary features of the distribution for median ACT score of the college?
2. Could there be concerns about specific features of this distribution if we are looking to do an analysis on this?

## Continuous Association
It is often interesting to estimate whether two continuous/interval attributes are associated or related to one another. This can be done with a statistic called the correlation. The correlation measures the degree to which the two attributes move together or not. For example, if one attribute increases does it give information about whether the second attribute increases (ie., a positive correlation) or decreases (ie., a negative correlation)? Before getting to the computation, exploring a sample can be helpful. 

First, to get a sense to what the correlation represents, it is useful to explore a scatterplot. The scatterplot depicts two attributes and places a point where the two attributes intersect. For this first example, a scatterplot with median college ACT score and admission rate are explored. 

```{r scatter-act, fig.cap = "Scatterplot of median college ACT score by college admission rate."}
gf_point(actcmmid ~ adm_rate, data = colleges, size = 3) %>%
  gf_labs(x = 'Admission Rate',
          y = 'Median College ACT Score')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:scatter-act) shows the bivariate relationship between median college ACT score and the college admission rate. If these two attributes are unrelated, it would not be possible to identify a trend in the scatterplot. However, in Figure \@ref(fig:scatter-act), there is a noticeable trend. As median college ACT scores increase, the admission rates tend to decrease. This is an example of a negative trend and would represent a negative relationship, association, or correlation. 

Although there is a trend in the relationship, there are exceptions to this rule. For instance, notice the points that have very low median college ACT scores, there are cases that have lower admission rates (about 0.25 or 25%) and some have higher admission rates (above 0.5 or 50%). Focusing on the single point at about 0.25 admission rate and 9 median college ACT score, most of the median college ACT scores for an admission rate around 0.25 are above 30, with a few clustered around 20. This indicates the variation and imperfect relationship between the two attributes. The mantra, "correlation does not mean causation" is common in statistics courses and this variation and imperfect relationship shows one example of this. In short, it requires very specific designs to the data collection to be able to make very strong statements about causation, most often the data available represent observations that were simply observed rather than being part of a more stringent experimental design. 

The correlation statistic provides a numeric summary of the degree of relationship between two quantitative attributes. These can be estimated with the `cor()` function. The primary argument is a formula like has been used before and is similar to the `gf_point()` function used above. The data argument is specified and one other argument may be helpful when there are data missing. This is the `use = 'complete.obs'` argument. Specifying this argument with `'complete.obs'` tells the `cor()` function to remove any missing data on the two attributes being specified and keep any data where pairs of data are present. 

```{r correlation-example}
cor(actcmmid ~ adm_rate, data = colleges, use = 'complete.obs')
```

The correlation estimate depicted here is `r round(cor(actcmmid ~ adm_rate, data = colleges, use = 'complete.obs'), 2)`, which carries two pieces of information. One, it shows the direction of association, here negative means that as one attribute increases the other tends to decrease (an inverse relationship). This was what was noticed in \@ref(fig:scatter-act). The second element the correlation shows is the magnitude of association. The correlation is standardized, meaning that regardless of the attributes used for the computation, the correlation will always be in the same range. The correlation will exclusively be between -1 to +1. Values of -1 or +1 indicate perfect negative or positive relationships respectively. A correlation of 0 means no relationship. The example above had a correlation of `r round(cor(actcmmid ~ adm_rate, data = colleges, use = 'complete.obs'), 2)`, which means the relationship is negative/inverse (as one attribute increases, the other tends to decrease) and the magnitude of association is about in between -1 and 0, but slightly closer to 0. What is considered a large, medium, or small association is largely dependent on the industry, but with education or social science data, this type of association would likely be considered a moderate or medium degree of association. 

The correlation makes one other assumption about the data. The correlation computed above and considered in this text is sometimes referred to as the Pearson correlation. This correlation assumes the data are best represented by a straight line or a linear relationship. If the relationship is not linear, but is best represented by a curved line, the correlation used in this course would likely underrepresent the degree of association. 

*Note: Add some more detail on + or close to 0 correlations*.

### Correlation Computation

The correlation can be represented by the following formula. In this formula, $\bar{x}, \bar{y}$ are the means for x and y respectively. THe terms, $x_{i}$, and $y_{i}$, represent the individual data elements for each attribute. The numerator of the formula represents the deviations from the mean for the two attributes, which are multiplied together and added. The numerator is also referred to as the covariance and measures the degree to which the two attributes move together. 

$$
r = \frac{\sum (x_{i} - \bar{x})(y_{i} - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum(x_{i} - \bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum(y_{i} - \bar{y})^2}}
$$

The denominator of the correlation are the standard deviation of the two attributes. These act to standardize the correlation so that no matter which attributes are entered into the formula, the correlation will always be between -1 and +1. 

*Note: maybe add piece about the covariance graphically*.

## First Regression Tree
Another, and related to the correlation, way to explore the relationship between two quantitative attributes is through the fitting a regression tree. A regression tree is similar to a classification tree, however now the output is a numeric or continuous type variable that takes on many different values. In the classification tree example, the focus in this class was predicting if a case belonged to one of two classes. The regression tree, in contrast, will predict the numeric variable with many potential values rather than just two. This will have implications for how the model is evaluated for accuracy as well as how well the model does at predicting specific values. These will be discussed in more detail later. 

The syntax for fitting a regression tree is very similar in R compared to the classification tree. The same function, `rpart()` is used and the function `rpart.plot()` will be used to visualize the fitted regression tree similar to before. The primary argument to the `rpart()` function is a formula where the left-hand side is the attribute of interest and the right hand side contains attributes that help predict the outcome. In the example below, the median college ACT score (`actcmmid`) is the outcome attribute and the college admission rate (`adm_rate`) is used as the sole continuous attribute used to predict the median college ACT score. The data argument is also specified and the only difference here between a classification tree and the regression tree here is the `method` argument. In the regression tree the method argument should be set to `method = 'anova'`. This tells the `rpart()` function that the outcome is numeric and that an anova method should be used in the model fitting. The anova stands for Analysis of Variance and we will discuss this in more detail moving forward.

```{r act-regression-tree, fig.cap = "The first regression tree predicting median college ACT score based on the admission rate."}
act_reg <- rpart(actcmmid ~ adm_rate, data = colleges, 
                 method = "anova")

rpart.plot(act_reg, roundint = FALSE, type = 3, branch = .3)
```

The output from the regression tree is similar to that from a classification tree. One major difference however is that the predicted values in the end are numeric quantities instead of classes and the probabilities that were shown previously are not shown here as there is not a probability of being in a class. The percentage of cases in the predicted nodes at the end of the tree are still shown. The logic for following the tree is the same as before where each split can have two new paths to follow and then the variable(s) are re-evaluated after the first split to see if additional splits can help predict the outcome of interest.

Below is a figure that builds on the scatterplot we saw above. Vertical lines are shown that indicate the splits that were established from the regression tree in Figure \@ref(fig:act-regression-tree). These splits are where the end buckets lie and all of the data points residing in a single area have the same median ACT score. For example, all schools in the left-most quadrant of Figure \@ref(fig:visualize-regression-tree) would all have the same predicted median ACT score of 32. In reality, one can see that the value of 32 is correct for some of the schools, but there are others in this quadrant that have median ACT scores of less than 20. The next section will explore how accuracy for the regression tree can be evaluated.

```{r visualize-regression-tree, fig.cap = "Visual depiction of the regression tree splits."}
gf_point(actcmmid ~ adm_rate, data = colleges, color = 'gray55') %>% 
    gf_labs(y = "Median college ACT score",
            x = "Admission Rate",
            title = "Log salary by number of home runs") +
  geom_parttree(data = act_reg, aes(fill = actcmmid), alpha = 0.3) + 
  scale_fill_continuous("ACT")
```

## Evaluating accuracy

In the classification tree example, a natural metric to evaluate how well the model was doing was the classification accuracy. Classification accuracy was often best computed for each class instead of a single overall accuracy statistic. In the regression tree example, there is no class membership, instead the original observed college ACT score and the predicted college ACT scores can be compared. One measure that could be used for accuracy is on average how far do the predicted scores deviate from the observed scores. Mathematically, this would look like:

$$
accuracy = predicted - observed
$$

However, this will have issues, as when the deviation was computed, those values above and below will offset one another. Therefore, simply computing the accuracy as the predicted score minus the observed score will on average be 0. Similarly to the standard deviation, we could square the difference between the predicted and observed values to get the mean square error. We could also take the square root of the mean square error (MSE) to get the root mean square error (RMSE), the benefit of the RMSE over the MSE is that the RMSE will be on the same metric as the outcome of interest. Mathematically, these can be represented as:

$$
MSE = \frac{\sum (predicted - observed) ^ 2}{n} \\

RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (predicted - observed) ^ 2}{n}}
$$

Another statistic can also be useful here, the mean absolute error (MAE). This statistic was first introduced in chapter 3 and is similar to the RMSE above, but except for squaring values and taking the square root, the absolute value is used instead. This has the strength of never squaring values, so the metric is the same as the outcome, but has the weakness of having weaker statistical properties. The mathematical computation can be shown as:

$$ 
MAE = \frac{\sum |predicted - observed|}{n}
$$

The below code chunk computes the deviation labeled as error. The first 10 rows are shown along with the institution name (`instnm`), median ACT score (`actcmmid`), and the predicted median ACT score (`act_pred`). Notice within the error column that there are some values above and below zero. You can see the values that have a negative error have an actual median ACT score less than the predicted values. Conversely, those that have positive errors have actual median ACT scores greater than the predicted ACT value. 

```{r}
colleges_pred <- colleges %>%
  drop_na(actcmmid) %>%
  mutate(act_pred = predict(act_reg),
         error = actcmmid - act_pred) %>%
  select(instnm, actcmmid, act_pred, error)
head(colleges_pred, n = 10)
```

The `df_stats()` function can used to compute summary statistics for the `error` attribute which represented the difference between the observed and predicted college ACT score. A variety of statistics are computed on the `error` attribute including the mean, median, variance (var), standard deviation (sd), minimum (min), and maximum (max). 

```{r}
colleges_pred %>%
  df_stats(~ error, mean, median, var, sd, min, max)
```

Notice from the statistics computed, the mean and median of the deviation or raw error (i.e., $predicted - observed$), the values are very close to zero and are practically zero for the mean. This is occurring due to the positive and negative errors are offsetting one another. The median isn't exactly zero as the distribution of errors are not perfectly symmetric. Figure \@ref(fig:error-dist) shows the distribution of errors. Notice there is a longer tail on the negative side, meaning that there are some predicted values that are much larger than the observed median ACT score. This is also shown by the min and max statistics computed above. 

```{r error-dist, fig.cap = "Distribution of error deviations from the regression tree model."}
gf_density(~ error, data = colleges_pred) %>%
  gf_labs(x = "Error = Predicted - Observed")
```

Circling back to the final statistic computed above, the variance (var) and standard deviation (sd) of the error term represents the MSE and RMSE respectively and are interpretable. In general, larger values of these statistics indicate less accuracy, that is, on average the squared deviations of the predicted minus the observed are larger. In practice, the RMSE is often used more than the MSE as the metric is the same as the outcome, in this case the median ACT scores. The RMSE of `r round(sd(colleges_pred$error), 2)` says that on average the predicted median institution ACT scores are about `r round(sd(colleges_pred$error), 2)` away from the observed median institution ACT score. 

The mean absolute error can be computed similarly, except instead of using the raw deviations (ie., errors), the absolute value of the deviations needs to be computed first. This is done using the `abs()` function shown below and specified as `abs(error)`. The `error` term represents the errors computed as the difference in the predicted and observed median ACT scores. Similar to the statistics computed above, the mean, median, minimum, and maximum statistics are computed. 

```{r}
colleges_pred %>%
  df_stats(~ abs(error), mean, median, min, max)
```

When interpreting these statistics, the mean and median column would represent the mean and median absolute error and are on the same scale as the outcome attribute, in this case the median ACT score. Therefore, the value of `r round(mean(abs(colleges_pred$error)), 2)` states that on average the predicted median ACT scores are within `r round(mean(abs(colleges_pred$error)), 2)` from the observed scores. The median is interpreted similarly, but instead of being the average absolute deviation, this represents the median absolute deviation. Finally, notice how the absolute value worked, the minimum statistic is positive, whereas before it was negative. The largest negative deviation/error from before is now the largest shown in the maximum column. The absolute value of the errors can be shown graphically to fully understand the new distribution. 

```{r absolute-error-dist, fig.cap = "The distribution of errors after taking the absolute value ."}
gf_density(~ abs(error), data = colleges_pred) %>%
  gf_labs(x = "Error = |Predicted - Observed|")
```

This distribution is not symmetric, rather it is more like an exponential distribution with many values close to zero and rather quickly decreasing in the number of errors that are larger. This indicates that much of the predictions are close to the observed value with a few that are further away indicating worse performance.

It is also worth mentioning that these accuracy statistics are scale dependent. Therefore if the scales of two outcomes are different, the MAE, MSE, or RMSE are not directly comparable without standardization. For example, if instead of median ACT scores, the outcome was median SAT scores, the accuracy statistics would naturally be larger due to SAT scores being larger. SAT scores for individual sections range from 200 to 800 instead of ACT scores ranging from 0 to 36. The MAE, MSE, or RMSE statistics would look larger due to scale differences, but that would not necessarily mean the model is doing worse. To compare these two outcomes, the outcomes or the accuracy statistics would need to be put on the same scale.

### Conditional Error
```{r}
colleges_pred %>%
  df_stats(abs(error) ~ actcmmid, mean, median, sd, min, max, length)

#### Explore another attribute
Let's explore another attribute, the undergraduate enrollment of institions to see if it is related to the median ACT score. First a scatterplot is shown then the correlation is computed.

More to come...

```{r}
act_reg2 <- rpart(actcmmid ~ adm_rate + ugds, data = colleges, method = "anova")

rpart.plot(act_reg2, roundint = FALSE, type = 3, branch = .3)
```

The figure below attempts to show the regression tree in a scatterplot. Now there are more predicted buckets and these are represented by the square areas of the figure below. All of the data points within each square would receive the same predicted score.

```{r}
ggplot(data = colleges, aes(x = adm_rate, y = ugds)) +
  geom_parttree(data = act_reg2, aes(fill = actcmmid), alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_point(aes(color = actcmmid)) +
  scale_colour_viridis_c(
    limits = range(colleges$actcmmid, na.rm = TRUE), 
    aesthetics = c('colour', 'fill')
    )
```
