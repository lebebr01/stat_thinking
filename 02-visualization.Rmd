## Univariate Data Visualization

Data visualization is an incredibly rich tool to explore and understand data. Data visualization is often a first way to see if there are extreme data values, how much variation there is in the data, and where typical values lie in the distribution. In this section of the course, we plan to explore the following related to distributions:

1. Univariate distributions
    + Shape
    + Center
    + Spread
    + Extreme Values
2. Multivariate distributions
    + Shape
    + Center
    + Spread
    + Extreme Values
    + Comparing distributions

## Univariate Distributions

The college scorecard (https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/) publishes data on higher education institutions to help make the institutions more transparent and provide a place for parents, students, educators, etc can get information about specific instituations from a third party (i.e. US Department of Education).


### Read in Data

The below code will read in the data for us to use in the future. The R function to read in the data is `read_csv()`. Function arguments are passed within the parentheses and for the `read_csv()` function the first argument is the path to the data. The data for this example are posted on GitHub in a comma separated file. This means the data is stored in a text format and each variable (i.e. column in the data) is separated by a comma. This is a common format data is stored.

The data is stored to an object named `college_score`. In R (and other statistical programming languages), it is common to use objects to store results to use later. In this instance, we would like to read in the data and store it to use it later. For example, we will likely want to explore the data visually to see if we can extract some trends from the data. The assignment to an object in R is done with the `<-` assignment operator. Finally, there is one additional argument, `guess_max` which helps to ensure that the data are read in appropriately. More on this later.

```{r read-data}
college_score <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lebebr01/statthink/master/data-raw/College-scorecard-clean.csv", guess_max = 10000)
```


### View the Data

The `head()` function is R is useful to get a quick snapshot of the data to ensure that is has been read in appropriately.

```{r view-data}
head(college_score)
```


## Univariate Distributions

Univariate distributions mean exploring the data for a single variable by itself. This can be useful as an initial exploration of the data to understand information about which values are typical, if there are any extreme values, what the range of the variable has, and other characteristics. Univariate distributions are useful, however in most data situations, these form the initial exploration only and multivariate thinking is needed, which we will explore next.

Using the college scorecard data, suppose we were interested in exploring the admission rate of higher education institutions to prioritize which institutions would be appropriate to apply to. One figure that is useful initially in this regard is the histrogram. A histogram can be created with the `ggformula` R package using the `gf_histrogram()` function. This function needs two arguments, the first is an equation that identifies the variables to be plotted and the second is the data using the format `data = ...` where the `...` is the name of the data object. Below is an example of the code used to create a histrogram.

```{r first-hist}
gf_histogram(~ adm_rate, data = college_score)
```

The equation argument above with the `ggformula` package takes the following general structure:
`y-axis ~ x-axis`
where the variable identified to the left of the `~` is the variable defined on the y-axis and the variable to the right of the `~` is the variable to be placed on the x-axis. If a variable is not specified (as is the case here) on one side of the equation, that axis is ignored. This is most commonly done when exploring univariate distributions where only a single variable is to be plotted.

### Interpretting Histograms

Histograms are created by collapsing the data into bins and the number of data points that fall in the range of the bin are counted. To show this more clearly in the figure created previously, we can add some color to show the different bins with the arguments, `color = 'black'`.

```{r color-hist-bars}
gf_histogram(~ adm_rate, data = college_score, color = 'black')
```


As you can see, now the different bins are able to be seen more easily.

### Adjusting Number of Bins

When creating histograms, the figure depends on where the boundaries of the bins can be found. It is often useful to change the number of bins to explore the impact these may have. This can be done two ways with the `gf_histogram()` function, either through the `bins` or `binwidth` arguments. The `bins` argument allows the user to specify the number of bins and the `bindwidth` argument allows the user to specify how wide the bins should be and the number of bins are calculated based on the bin size and the range of the data. Below are two different ways to specify these:

```{r}
gf_histogram(~ adm_rate, data = college_score, color = 'black', bins = 25)
```

```{r}
gf_histogram(~ adm_rate, data = college_score, color = 'black', binwidth = .01)
```

## Plot Customization

So far we have not customized our plots to label the axes appropriately or add a title to the figure. These actions can be accomplished with the `gf_labs()` function.

### Change x-axis label

Adjusting the x-axis label is done with the `gf_labs()` function by using the argument `x = '...'` where the `...` is the text that the label should take. Below is an example:

```{r}
gf_histogram(~ adm_rate, data = college_score, color = 'black', bins = 25) %>%
  gf_labs(x = 'Admission Rate (in %)')
```

### Change plot title

The plot title can be changed similar to the x-axis label, but instead of using the `x = '...'`, `title = '...'` is used instead. Here is an example:

```{r}
gf_histogram(~ adm_rate, data = college_score, color = 'black', bins = 25) %>%
  gf_labs(x = 'Admission Rate (in %)',
          title = 'Univariate distribution of higher education admission rates')
```

### Change plot theme

The default plot theme has a grey background with white grid lines. I personally do not prefer this color scheme and instead prefer a white background with darker grid lines. This can be changes with the `gf_theme()` function. Below is an example:

```{r}
gf_histogram(~ adm_rate, data = college_score, color = 'black', bins = 25) %>%
  gf_labs(x = 'Admission Rate (in %)',
          title = 'Univariate distribution of higher education admission rates') %>%
  gf_theme(theme_bw())
```

It is possible to set a theme and change the default that is used. This can be done with the `theme_set()` function as the following:

```{r}
theme_set(theme_bw())

gf_histogram(~ adm_rate, data = college_score, color = 'black', bins = 25) %>%
  gf_labs(x = 'Admission Rate (in %)',
          title = 'Univariate distribution of higher education admission rates')
```

#### Book Theme
A custom theme has been created for the book. This has been included in the supplemental book package that can be installed and loaded with the following commands:

```{r install-book-package}
remotes::install_github('lebebr01/statthink')
library(statthink)
```

The book theme can then be applied as before:

```{r apply-book-theme}
theme_set(theme_statthinking())

gf_histogram(~ adm_rate, data = college_score, color = 'black', bins = 25) %>%
  gf_labs(x = 'Admission Rate (in %)',
          title = 'Univariate distribution of higher education admission rates')
```

## Density plots

Another useful univariate plot is the density plot. This plot usually gives similar information as the histogram, but the visualization does not depend on the bins. One nice feature of density plots is that the area under the density figure sums to 1 as is obtained from kernel density estimation. In this class we will use a normal kernel to estimate the distribution of interest. Density figures can be created with the `gf_density()` function and the same primary arguments when creating histograms are used. More specifically this includes the formula identifying the variables of interest and the data to be used.

```{r}
gf_density(~ adm_rate, data = college_score)
```

The x-axis labels and plot title can be added the same as with the histogram.

```{r}
gf_density(~ adm_rate, data = college_score) %>%
  gf_labs(x = 'Admission Rate (in %)',
          title = 'Univariate distribution of higher education admission rates')
```


## Multivariate Data Visualization
 
Real world data are never as simple exploring a distribution of a single variable, particularly when trying to understand individual variation. In most cases things interact, move in tandem, and many phenomena help to explain the variable of interest. For example, when thinking about admission rates, what may be some important factors that would explain some of the reasons why higher education institutions differ in their admission rates? Take a few minutes to brainstorm some ideas.
 

```{r}
gf_histogram(~ adm_rate, data = college_score, bins = 30, fill = ~ preddeg) %>%
  gf_labs(x = 'Admission Rate (in %)',
          title = 'Multivariate distribution of higher education admission rates by degree type',
          fill = "Primary Deg")
```

Often density plots are easier to visualize when there are more than one group. To plot more than one density curve, we need to specify the color argument instead of fill.

```{r}
gf_density(~ adm_rate, data = college_score, color = ~ preddeg) %>%
  gf_labs(x = 'Admission Rate (in %)',
          title = 'Multivariate distribution of higher education admission rates by degree type',
          color = "Primary Deg")
```

```{r}
gf_density(~ adm_rate, data = college_score, fill = ~ preddeg) %>%
  gf_labs(x = 'Admission Rate (in %)',
          title = 'Multivariate distribution of higher education admission rates by degree type',
          fill = "Primary Deg")
```

```{r}
gf_density(~ adm_rate, data = college_score, fill = ~ preddeg, color = ~ preddeg) %>%
  gf_labs(x = 'Admission Rate (in %)',
          title = 'Multivariate distribution of higher education admission rates by degree type',
          color = "Primary Deg",
          fill = "Primary Deg")
```

```{r}
gf_density(~ adm_rate, data = college_score, color = ~ preddeg, fill = 'gray85', size = 1) %>%
  gf_labs(x = 'Admission Rate (in %)',
          title = 'Multivariate distribution of higher education admission rates by degree type',
          color = "Primary Deg")
```
## Violin Plots
 
Violin plots are another way to make comparisons of distributions across groups. Violin plots are also easier to show more groups on a single graph. Violin plots are density plots that are mirrored to be fully enclosed. Best to explore with an example.ArithmeticError

```{r}
gf_violin(adm_rate ~ preddeg, data = college_score) %>%
  gf_labs(y = 'Admission Rate (in %)',
          title = 'Multivariate distribution of higher education admission rates by degree type',
          x = "Primary Deg")
```

Aesthetically, these figures are a bit more pleasing to look at if they include a light fill color. This is done similar to the density plots shown above with the `fill = ` argument.ArithmeticError

```{r}
gf_violin(adm_rate ~ preddeg, data = college_score, fill = 'gray85') %>%
  gf_labs(y = 'Admission Rate (in %)',
          title = 'Multivariate distribution of higher education admission rates by degree type',
          x = "Primary Deg")
```

Adding quantiles are useful to aid in the comparison with the violin plots. These can be added with the `draw_quantiles` argument.

```{r}
gf_violin(adm_rate ~ preddeg, data = college_score, fill = 'gray85', draw_quantiles = c(.1, .5, .9)) %>%
  gf_labs(y = 'Admission Rate (in %)',
          title = 'Multivariate distribution of higher education admission rates by degree type',
          x = "Primary Deg")
```
### Violin Plots with many groups
 
Many groups are more easily shown in the violin plot framework.

With many groups, it is often of interest to put the long x-axis labels representing each group on the y-axis so that it reads the correct direction and the labels do not run into each other. This can be done with the `gf_refine()` function with `coord_flip()`.

```{r}
gf_violin(adm_rate ~ region, data = college_score, fill = 'gray80', draw_quantiles = c(.1, .5, .9)) %>%
  gf_labs(y = 'Admission Rate (in %)',
          title = 'Multivariate distribution of higher education admission rates by degree type',
          x = "US Region") %>%
  gf_refine(coord_flip())
```

## Facetting
 
Facetting is another way to explore distributions of two or more variables.

```{r}
gf_violin(adm_rate ~ region, data = college_score, fill = 'gray80', draw_quantiles = c(.1, .5, .9)) %>%
  gf_labs(y = 'Admission Rate (in %)',
          title = 'Multivariate distribution of higher education admission rates by degree type',
          x = "US Region") %>%
  gf_refine(coord_flip()) %>%
  gf_facet_wrap(~ preddeg)
```
