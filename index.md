# Preface {-}
  
This book provides a modern statistical reasoning and introduction to statistics text. Computation, using the R programming language, are used instead of relying on traditional statistical theory.

These analyses can often be categorized into two broad categories,

1. Descriptive Statistics
2. Inferential Statistics

**Descriptive Statistics** help to describe the data and are particularly useful to give a single numeric summary for a single variable. We will explore this idea more fully in this section.
**Inferential Statistics** help us to make broader statements from the data we have to the larger group of interest, commonly referred to as the population. More details on these steps later in the course.
